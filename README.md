phantom-args
-----------

Command line argument utility for PhantomJS
### Features
* Specify arguments in `args.json`
* Get a nice json object back containing all the values that were set in the args
* Get on with writing your program rather than processing the args!

### Coming soon
* Similar argument processor for Node.js applications
* Possibly an all-in-one project
